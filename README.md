### USER STORIES

i. User would log into the app portal.

ii. They would then be taken to their profile/details page. There they can view 
     all the bags they have created and would also have the ability to 
     create, update, or delete a bag.

iii. From the navigation bar, a user can select "available bags" to view 
     an index of bags currently available on the platform.
     
## User #1: 
     
Single mom of two. Between balancing work and the closures of her kids' schools, 
     by the time she made it to the grocery store, she couldn't find some items 
     her family really needed. Things like rice, milk, peanut butter, tomato 
     sauce and cleaning products. If only there were a way to 
     ask her neighbors...
     
## User #2: 
     
A couple in their 30s with no kids. They realized they had some excess items 
     they don't need and would like them to go to someone who needs them but 
     don't know how to go about doing so...
     
## User #3: 
     
75 year old with diabetes, has been afraid to go out to get some items 
     that he needs, especially toilet paper. He does have a ton of 
     cans of tuna he'd be willing to trade.


### TECHNOLOGIES USED

     This project was created with:
          - Django
          - Python
          - Bulma
          - CSS
          - Visual Studio Code
          - Heroku


### APPROACH TAKEN
#### To build this app, we took the following approach
          - Good old fashioned brainstorming!
          - Wireframing
          - Writing up user stories

#### Responsive First
     This project was designed with mobile users in mind. We chose Bulma
          as our front-end framework to get us started, which allowed us
          to get a user-friendly project off the ground quickly.
     
#### Challenges and Triumphs
##### Challenges
<img src="https://git.generalassemb.ly/kuricarino/cuppa-sugga/blob/master/django.png" width="800">
     - Stripping Materialize from a previous application and researching new frameworks in a short amount of time to create a responsive and mobile friendly app posed unique challenges.
     - Refactoring previous code, rethinking the ERD and setting up Model structure. The One-to-One relationship between the Django User Model and our Profile Model proved to be a lot of trial and error.
     - Dealing with Python's synchonicity -- how it affects user flow and creating work-arounds.

##### Triumphs!
     - Maintaining communication and collaboration througout planning and execution to successfully tie the front-end and back-end as smoothly as possible.
     - All three of us kept scope and the final project in mind in order to not only reach MVP, but create something we were proud of.

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
     Simply open the link in any modern browser! No special installation is required.

### UNSOLVED/KNOWN ISSUES
     - Currently, a user creates a bag and is redirected back to their Profile. We would have liked to redirect the user to the Bag Details page, but because of synchronicity, we were unable to (if we had time to create the Item Model, would have been able to error handle this)

### FUTURE RELEASE FEATURES
     - Flesh out the Item Model 
     - Add Geolocation
     - Add a "trade/barter" feature
     - Add more animations throughout the site
     - Add "Build A Bag" Button to Profile
     - Add bag images to each bag (instead of a card)

### OTHER COMPONENTS PREVIOUSLY INDICATED (if applicable)
Not applicable.

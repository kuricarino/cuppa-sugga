### WHY DID WE MAKE IT?
     ...

### USER STORIES


     i.        The user opens the game in their browser.

     ii.       The game deals seven cats to the player, which are visible at the bottom of the screen, 
                    and places a [randomly generated] cat immediately into the box. The user compares 
                    their cats against the one at the top of the box, looking for match against the 
                    cat's **color** (pink, orange, goldenrod, green, blue, purple, biscuit, gray, or soot), 
                    or the cat's **mood** (happy, angry, neutral, or sleeping).

     iii.      When the user clicks an cat that doesn't match, it shakes, then bounces back (happily). 
                    The user then either selects an applicable cat, or else takes a new cat home by 
                    clicking the "draw" button.

     iv.       When the user clicks a cat that matches, the cat enters the box and bounces (happily). 
                    This triggers the computer's turn.

     v.        The user waits for the computer (neighbor) to select a cat. If the computer has 
                    no valid (willing) cat, the computer is dealt a new cat.

     vi.       After the computer takes a turn, the user and computer trade turns.

### APPROACH TAKEN
#### To build this app, we took the following approach
          - Good old fashioned brainstorming!
          - Wireframing
          - Writing up user stories

#### Responsive First
     I approached the project with a <em>function first</em> mindset. I believe that, 
     though design is fundamentally important, it doesn't matter how pretty an app is 
     if it doesn't work. As such, I let the game look terrible until the functionality was 
     sound, and then I put the graphics together during a polishing process on the last day. 
     The result is a cute, playable game!

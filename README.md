### WHY DID WE MAKE IT?
     ...

### USER STORIES

i. User would log into the app portal.

ii. They would then be taken to their profile/details page. There they can view 
     all the bags they have created and would also have the ability to 
     create, update, or delete a bag.

iii. From the navigation bar, a user can select "available bags" to view 
     an index of bags currently available on the platform.
     
## User #1: 
     
Single mom of two. Between balancing work and the closures of her kids' schools, 
     by the time she made it to the grocery store, she couldn't find some items 
     her family really needed. Things like rice, milk, peanut butter, tomato 
     sauce and cleaning products. If only there were a way to 
     ask her neighbors...
     
## User #2: 
     
A couple in their 30s with no kids. They realized they had some excess items 
     they don't need and would like them to go to someone who needs them but 
     don't know how to go about doing so...
     
## User #3: 
     
75 year old with diabetes, has been afraid to go out to get some items 
     that he needs, especially toilet paper. He does have a ton of 
     cans of tuna he'd be willing to trade.
